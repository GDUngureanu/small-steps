# SCSS

Custom Bootstrap variables and utility classes. Overrides live in
`_variables.scss`; additional helpers can be added under this directory and
imported from `main.scss`.

## Local Development

Styles are compiled by Vite automatically. To watch for changes:

```sh
npm start
```

## Entry Points

`main.scss` is imported in `main.js` and serves as the root of the style
dependency tree.
