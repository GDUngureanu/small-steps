# System Overview

This project is a Vue 3 single-page application geared toward mindful living and personal growth. The frontend uses the Composition API and communicates with Supabase for persistence and authentication.

## Modules

- **Components** – feature-specific views rendered through Vue Router.
- **Composables** – reusable logic such as authentication and action management.
- **Config** – environment and third‑party service initialisation.
- **Templates** – shared layout pieces for building new sections quickly.
- **SCSS** – Bootstrap customisation and theme variables.

See the README in each module for local development tips and entry points.
